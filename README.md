# Quaderno

Quaderno is a Swift framework that provides easy access to the [Quaderno API](https://github.com/recrea/quaderno-api).


## Why Using It?

You can implement your own client for the [Quaderno API](https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-api). However, using Quaderno gives you instant access to the same interface without messing around with low-level HTTP requests and JSON-encoded data.

Note that you need a valid account to use Quaderno.


## Supported OS & SDK Versions

* Supported build target - iOS 9.0
* Earliest supported deployment target - iOS 9.0
* Earliest compatible deployment target - iOS 8.0

*'Supported'* means that the library has been tested with this version. *'Compatible'* means that the library should work on this OS version (i.e. it doesn't rely on any unavailable SDK features) but is no longer being tested for compatibility and may require tweaking or bug fixes to run correctly.


## Installation

Add Quaderno to your Podfile if you are using CocoaPods:

```ruby
pod "Quaderno", "~> 0.0.1"
```

Otherwise just drag the `.swift` source files under the `Source` directory into your project.

> **Embedded frameworks require a minimum deployment target of iOS 8.**
>
> To use Quaderno with application targets that do not support embedded frameworks, such as iOS 7, you must include all source files directly in your project.


## Usage

### Import Module

```swift
import Quaderno
```


## Persistence

Quaderno does not automatically persist your objects for you.


## Development

###Getting Started

Quaderno uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage dependencies. See `Podfile` to get a comprehensive list of dependencies.

After cloning this repository run the following commands:

```bash
pod install
```

###Project Structure

The entry point for the project is the `Quaderno.xcworkspace` file, which contains two projects:

1. `Quaderno.xcodeproj`, with the source code of the framework.
2. `Pods.xcodeproj`, with third-party dependencies automatically managed by CocoaPods.

###Documentation

The source code is documented using the markup formatting commands defined by Apple.

An HTML version of the documentation generated with [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) is also available under the `docs` directory.


## More Information

Remember that this is only a Swift wrapper for the original API. If you want more information about the API itself, head to the original [API documentation](https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-api).
